# Pipmak SDL2

This is a "port" of original [Pipmak Game Engine](http://pipmak.sourceforge.net/) to SDL2.

## Building
Currently only Windows build is supported.
Assuming VS2022 is installed at default location.

1. Run `pipmak/misc/external.bat` to compile all required dependencies.
2. Run `pipmak/build.bat` to compile.

The result will be at `build\pipmak`.
